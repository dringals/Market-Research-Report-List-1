<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water And Oil Repellents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluoropolymer</li><li>Non-fluoropolymer</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Water and oil repellents are used to create a barrier on various surfaces, preventing the penetration of water or oil. Fluoropolymer repellents are a type of repellent that contain fluorocarbon polymers, which provide excellent water and oil resistance due to their strong carbon-fluorine bonds. Non-fluoropolymer repellents, on the other hand, do not contain fluorocarbon polymers but still offer resistance to water and oil. These repellents are typically made from other types of polymers or chemicals that have properties to repel liquids.</p></p>
