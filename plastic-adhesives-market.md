<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based</li><li>Water-Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The plastic adhesives market is divided into two major types: solvent-based and water-based adhesives. Solvent-based adhesives are formulated using organic solvents, and they offer high bonding strength and fast drying time. However, they emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and pose health risks. Water-based adhesives, on the other hand, are made with water as the primary solvent. They are environmentally friendly, have low VOC emissions, and are commonly used in industries demanding low toxicity and high sustainability. Both types have their specific applications and advantages but differ in their composition and environmental impact.</p></p>
