<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biological Insecticide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Microbial Pesticide</li><li>Plant Pesticide</li><li>Biochemical Pesticide</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Biological insecticides consist of three main types: microbial pesticides, plant pesticides, and biochemical pesticides. Microbial pesticides use microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses to control pests by infecting or directly affecting them. Plant pesticides are derived from plants and include botanical extracts, oils, and compounds with pesticidal properties. Biochemical pesticides are synthetic substances that mimic naturally occurring compounds to alter the behavior or physiology of pests. All these types of biological insecticides offer environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional chemical pesticides.</p></p>
