<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Steering Shaft Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rack and Pinion Type</li><li>Worm Crank Pin Type</li><li>Recirculating Ball Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The car steering shaft market consists of three main types: rack and pinion, worm crank pin, and recirculating ball. Rack and pinion steering uses a gear mechanism, where a circular pinion gear turns a linear rack to facilitate steering. Worm crank pin steering employs a worm gear and a crankshaft connected to the pitman arm, allowing rotational motion to be converted into linear motion. Recirculating ball steering uses a worm gear and a series of ball bearings to translate the rotational movement of the steering wheel into linear motion to steer the vehicle.</p></p>
