<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passive Hydroponics Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydroponic Drip Systems</li><li>Flood & Drain Systems</li><li>N.F.T. (Nutrient Film Technique)</li><li>Water Culture Hydroponic Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passive hydroponics systems are a popular choice in the market, with several types available. Hydroponic drip systems involve slow dripping of nutrient solution onto the base of plants. Flood and drain systems flood the plant roots periodically, allowing them to absorb the nutrient solution before draining. N.F.T. (Nutrient Film Technique) systems use a narrow stream of nutrient solution continuously flowing past the plant roots. Water culture hydroponic systems submerge plant roots directly into the nutrient solution. These systems offer efficient nutrient delivery and require minimal maintenance.</p></p>
