<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ice Melter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Ice Melter</li><li>Solid Ice Melter</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The ice melter market consists of two main types: liquid ice melter and solid ice melter. Liquid ice melters are usually in the form of a liquid solution and are applied by spraying or spreading. They work by lowering the freezing point of water and melting ice upon contact. Solid ice melters are commonly in the form of pellets, flakes, or granules. They are spread on icy surfaces and slowly dissolve, creating a brine that melts the ice. Both types are effective in combating icy conditions and ensuring safety on roads, walkways, and other surfaces.</p></p>
