<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Airless Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tires</li><li>Radial Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive airless tires are available in two types: bias tires and radial tires. Bias tires are constructed by overlapping multiple layers of ply cords diagonally across each other in a crisscross pattern, allowing the tire to be more flexible and durable. On the other hand, radial tires have ply cords that are placed perpendicular to the tire's circumference, enhancing stability and providing a smoother ride. Both types have their own advantages and are widely used in the automotive industry to improve performance and eliminate the risk of flat tires.</p></p>
