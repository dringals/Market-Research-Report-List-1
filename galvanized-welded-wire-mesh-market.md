<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Welded Wire Mesh Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot-dip Galvanized Welded Wire Mesh</li><li>Cold Galvanized Welded Wire Mesh</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Galvanized Welded Wire Mesh market is divided into two types: Hot-dip Galvanized Welded Wire Mesh and Cold Galvanized Welded Wire Mesh. Hot-dip galvanization involves immersing the wire mesh in a molten zinc bath, creating a thick and durable coating that protects against corrosion. Cold galvanization, on the other hand, applies a thin layer of zinc to the wire mesh through electroplating. Both methods enhance the longevity and strength of the wire mesh, making them suitable for various applications such as construction, agriculture, and industrial purposes.</p></p>
