<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fibre Optics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multimode Fibre</li><li>Single-mode Fibre</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fibre optics market comprises two main types: multimode fibre and single-mode fibre. Multimode fibre enables the transmission of multiple light modes simultaneously, allowing for the transmission of larger quantities of data over short distances. Single-mode fibre, on the other hand, accommodates only one mode of light at a time, which permits transmission over longer distances with minimal signal loss. Both multimode and single-mode fibres are widely used in telecommunications and data networking industries to support high-speed and reliable data transmission.</p></p>
