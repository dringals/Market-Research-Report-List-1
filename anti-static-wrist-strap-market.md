<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-static Wrist Strap Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Corded Wrist Strap</li><li>Cordless Wrist Strap</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The anti-static wrist strap market is comprised of two main types: corded wrist straps and cordless wrist straps. Corded wrist straps consist of a wristband connected to a cord that is linked to an electrical ground. This allows static electricity to be safely discharged. On the other hand, cordless wrist straps operate without a cord, typically utilizing battery-powered technology to generate an anti-static effect. Both types of wrist straps serve the purpose of preventing static electricity buildup on the human body, particularly in environments where electrostatic discharge can damage sensitive electronic components.</p></p>
