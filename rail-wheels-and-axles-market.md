<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rail Wheels and Axles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolled Wheels & Axles</li><li>Forged Wheels & Axles</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rail wheels and axles are important components in the railroad industry. Rolled wheels and axles are manufactured through a process called rolling, where the metal is heated, shaped, and then cooled. This method is suitable for producing large batches of wheels and axles with consistent quality. On the other hand, forged wheels and axles are created by applying great heat and pressure to shape the metal. This process results in a more durable product that can withstand heavy loads and rough conditions. Both types of wheels and axles play a crucial role in the smooth functioning of railway systems.</p></p>
