<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flooring Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Based Flooring Coating</li><li>Solvent-Based Flooring Coating</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flooring coating refers to the process of applying a protective layer on floors to enhance their durability and aesthetics. Water-based flooring coating is a type of coating that uses water as a solvent, making it eco-friendly and low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Solvent-based flooring coating, on the other hand, uses chemical solvents as a base, providing a more durable and resistant finish. While water-based coatings are gaining popularity due to their environmental benefits, solvent-based coatings are still preferred in industries where high performance and resistance to chemicals are crucial.</p></p>
