<p><strong>The Automotive Ecalls Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic</li><li>Manual Button</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive eCalls are emergency notification systems installed in vehicles to provide immediate assistance in the event of an accident or emergency. There are two types of eCall markets: automatic and manual button. Automatic eCalls are triggered by sensors that detect a sudden impact or airbag deployment, sending a distress signal to emergency services. Manual button eCalls require the driver or passenger to press a dedicated button in the vehicle to initiate the call for help. Both types aim to reduce emergency response times and ensure timely assistance in critical situations.</p></p>
