<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrostatic Discharges Safe Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ionic Type</li><li>Non-ionic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrostatic discharges (ESD) safe plastics are materials used to prevent the build-up and discharge of static electricity, which can damage sensitive electronic components. Ionic type ESD safe plastics contain additives that release ions into the surrounding environment, neutralizing electric charges. This type of plastic is effective in dissipating static electricity but may cause contamination in cleanroom environments. Non-ionic type ESD safe plastics, on the other hand, rely on their inherently low surface electrical resistance to prevent static charge accumulation. They offer high cleanliness and are suitable for use in sensitive manufacturing processes.</p></p>
