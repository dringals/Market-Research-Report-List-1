<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fiber in Light Weight Pressure Vessels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)</li><li>Pitch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon fiber is a material used in the production of lightweight pressure vessels. There are two main types of carbon fiber used: Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and Pitch. PAN carbon fibers are produced by polymerizing acrylonitrile and spinning it into fibers. These fibers are then carbonized and graphitized, resulting in high strength and stiffness. Pitch carbon fibers, on the other hand, are made by heat-treating coal-tar pitch to form solid fibers. These fibers have lower stiffness but higher heat resistance compared to PAN fibers. Both types offer advantages for different applications in the pressure vessel industry.</p></p>
