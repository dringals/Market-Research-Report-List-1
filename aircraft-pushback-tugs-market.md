<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Pushback Tugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional/Towbars Pushback Tugs</li><li>Towbarless Pushback Tugs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft pushback tugs are used to maneuver aircraft on the ground. There are two main types: Conventional/towbars pushback tugs and towbarless pushback tugs. Conventional tugs use a towbar attached to the aircraft's nose gear to push or pull it. They require more manpower and take longer to connect. Towbarless tugs, on the other hand, use specialized lifting mechanisms to directly lift the aircraft's nose gear. This type is more efficient, reducing the time and manpower required for pushback operations.</p></p>
