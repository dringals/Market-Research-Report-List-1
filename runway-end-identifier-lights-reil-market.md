<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Runway End Identifier Lights REIL Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Approach Lights</li><li>Runway Lights</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL) are a type of lighting system used to help pilots identify the approach end of a runway. These lights consist of two synchronized flashing lights placed on each side of the runway threshold. They provide a visual cue to pilots during approach and landing, especially in low visibility conditions. Approach Lights, on the other hand, are a series of lights that guide pilots during the final approach to the runway. They provide important information on the runway alignment and descent path. Runway Lights are used to illuminate the runway surface, ensuring visibility for pilots during takeoff, landing, and taxiing.</p></p>
