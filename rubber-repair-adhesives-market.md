<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rubber Repair Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Bond</li><li>Cold Bond</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rubber repair adhesives are divided into two main types: hot bond and cold bond. Hot bond adhesives require heat to cure and create a strong bond between the rubber surfaces. They are typically used for large repairs and in industrial settings. On the other hand, cold bond adhesives do not require heat and are suitable for smaller repairs and DIY applications. They can bond rubber surfaces at room temperature, making them more convenient for quick fixes and smaller projects.</p></p>
