<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Feeder and Jumper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Feeder Cable</li><li>Jumper Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Feeder and Jumper cables are two types of cables used in telecommunications and power distribution systems. Feeder cables, also known as trunk or distribution cables, are used to transmit signals over long distances or across networks. They are designed to carry higher power and are generally larger in diameter. On the other hand, jumper cables are shorter and thinner cables used to connect various devices within a network or distribution system. They are used for shorter distances and provide flexibility in routing and connecting different components. Both types of cables play crucial roles in maintaining efficient communication and power distribution systems.</p></p>
