<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Rain Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OEMS</li><li>Aftermarket</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive rain sensor market consists of two main types: OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) and aftermarket. OEM rain sensors are directly integrated into vehicles during manufacturing, providing automated rain-sensing functionality as a standard feature. On the other hand, aftermarket rain sensors are installations or retrofits made to existing vehicles after they have been purchased. Aftermarket rain sensors offer an alternative solution for vehicle owners who wish to upgrade their vehicles with this convenient technology. Both OEMs and aftermarket serve the same purpose of improving driver safety and convenience by automatically detecting and adjusting to rain conditions.</p></p>
