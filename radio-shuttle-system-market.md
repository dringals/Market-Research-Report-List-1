<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radio Shuttle System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LIFO Type</li><li>FIFO Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Radio Shuttle System market offers two types: LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out). In LIFO, the system retrieves the last product that was stored first, making it ideal for inventory management with products having a longer shelf life or no expiration date. FIFO, on the other hand, follows a "first in, first out" approach, ensuring the retrieval of the first product stored in order to minimize expiration and ensure freshness. The choice between these market types depends on the specific needs and characteristics of the goods being stored.</p></p>
