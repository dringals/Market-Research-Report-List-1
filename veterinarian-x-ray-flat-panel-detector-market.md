<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Veterinarian X Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Conversion</li><li>Indirect Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the veterinarian X-ray flat panel detector market, there are two types of detectors available: direct conversion and indirect conversion. Direct conversion detectors directly convert X-ray photons into electric charges, resulting in improved image quality and greater efficiency. On the other hand, indirect conversion detectors use scintillator materials to convert X-ray photons into light, which is then converted into electric charges. While indirect conversion detectors are more cost-effective, direct conversion detectors offer advantages in terms of image resolution and speed.</p></p>
