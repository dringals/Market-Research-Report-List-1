<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Braking Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brake</li><li>Disc Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial vehicle braking systems can be categorized into two main types: drum brakes and disc brakes. The drum brake system consists of a drum attached to the wheel, which rotates with the wheel's movement. When the brake pedal is pressed, brake shoes are pushed against the drum's inner surface, creating friction and slowing down the vehicle. On the other hand, disc brakes feature a disc attached to the wheel, and when the brake pedal is pressed, brake pads clamp onto the disc, creating friction and decelerating the vehicle. Both systems are essential for ensuring the safety and reliable braking performance of commercial vehicles.</p></p>
