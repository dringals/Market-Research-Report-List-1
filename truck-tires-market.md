<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Diagonal Tires</li><li>Radial Tires</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Truck tires market consists of two main types: Diagonal Tires and Radial Tires. Diagonal tires are constructed by laying the cords diagonally across the tire from one bead to the other, forming a crisscross pattern. These tires offer good traction and are suitable for off-road applications. On the other hand, radial tires have cords that run radially from the bead to the tread, providing strength and flexibility. Radial tires offer better fuel efficiency and road grip, making them ideal for on-road applications.</p></p>
