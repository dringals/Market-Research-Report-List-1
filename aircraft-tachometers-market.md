<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Tachometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Analog Type</li><li>Digital Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Aircraft tachometers are used to measure and display the rotational speed of an aircraft engine. There are two main types of aircraft tachometers: analog type and digital type. Analog type tachometers have a traditional dial display with a needle that indicates the engine speed. They are simple, reliable, and easy to read. On the other hand, digital type tachometers have a digital display that shows the engine speed numerically. They provide more accurate readings and often come with additional features such as data logging and advanced diagnostics.</p></p>
