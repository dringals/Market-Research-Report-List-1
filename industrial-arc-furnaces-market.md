<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Arc Furnaces Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC-EAF</li><li>DC-EAF</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Industrial arc furnaces are used for melting metals and alloys in various industries. There are two main types of arc furnaces: AC-EAF (Alternating Current Electric Arc Furnace) and DC-EAF (Direct Current Electric Arc Furnace). AC-EAF uses alternating current to create an electric arc, which provides intense heat for efficient metal melting. On the other hand, DC-EAF uses direct current for the same purpose. Both types offer advantages depending on specific requirements, such as power consumption, efficiency, and control over the melting process.</p></p>
