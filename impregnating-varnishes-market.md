<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impregnating Varnishes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent based Varnishes</li><li>Water based Varnishes</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Impregnating varnishes are classified into two main types: solvent-based varnishes and water-based varnishes. Solvent-based varnishes are formulated with organic solvents to dissolve the resins and provide a smooth finish when applied. These varnishes offer excellent penetration and durability, making them suitable for various applications. On the other hand, water-based varnishes are made with water as the primary solvent, making them more environmentally friendly. They provide a less harmful option while still offering good penetration and protection to the substrate.</p></p>
